## Assignment
[Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install PostgreSQL on your devices (for Mac users I recommend the [app](https://postgresapp.com/))
* Using Figma/Lucidchart, create an ER Diagram of your database
* Create a brand new database with a specific topic (eg pizza, students, employees, etc.) with 
  * At least four different tables.
  * Each table should have a primary key
  * Each table should have at least four dummy tuples
  * Each table should be able to be joined with one other table in the database (this will make sense once you understand schemas)
* Write an inner join query that joins two tables, one that joins three tables and one that joins all four tables (you can stack inner joins)
* Finally using Postman, try to post a brand new line of data and get two different lines of dummy data that you placed inside the database.
